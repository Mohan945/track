Leaver Activity Automation:
The earlier leaver script was non-functional due to missing key components. I have developed a new shell script to handle leaver user locking and cleanup, and automated the process via OEM.
Additionally, I introduced a new feature to track and report locked users during the processâ€”this capability was missing in the old script and now adds better audit visibility.

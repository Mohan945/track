Hi Team,

I’d like to share recent automation work I’ve completed to improve operational efficiency and reduce manual intervention:
	•	Leaver Process:
I developed a new shell script to replace the old, non-functional one and automated the leaver handling process via OEM. I also added a new feature to track and report locked users, which sends an email summary with usernames and database names after execution.
	•	Schema Refresh:
I have fully automated the schema refresh process using a config-driven shell script. This removes the need to log in during weekends to take export backups. The entire flow—from export to cleanup and import—is now handled automatically via OEM, making the process faster, more accurate, and completely hands-free. A completion report is sent via email.
	•	Documentation:
I’ve created detailed SOPs for both processes and uploaded them to OneDrive for team reference.

Please feel free to review and share any feedback.
